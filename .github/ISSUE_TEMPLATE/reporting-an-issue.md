**Describe the issue**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Provide the exact spec reference, including version or date of publication. If the spec is not officially published, indicate so and acknowledge that CW's master branch is intended for published specs. Search for another branch that main contain code to support to-be-published specifications

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. CW version. Don't forget to check the versions of the specs that this version of CW supports (may vary across branches).
2. Bitstream that does not behave as expected.
3. Command-line.
4. Copy of the issue output.

**Detailed analysis**
It can be: a) simply a rule is missing; b) a more involved explanation linking statements from different paragraphs from different specs.

In all cases, provide the exact spec text (preferably copy/paste in the issue and provide exact section reference) that should be implemented. That text should use normative statements "shall"/"should"/"must"/"require" ...). Note that if the specification text does not use normative statements, it is unlikely that CW will be modified. Reach out to the standard organization first if that is the case (and provide any reference to that conversation, if public).

**Potential patch**
Let us know about how you would solve the issue.
